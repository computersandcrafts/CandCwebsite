                    Computers and Crafts is an engineering company based in the south of Wales, United kingdom. What started off as hobbitual engineering work
                    on a wide range of items from guitar repair to PC system maintanence soon grew into a full established business with a grand total of two employees.
                    The initial focus of the company was to provide the specific details on performance regarding second hand items sold on various marketplaces, mainly
                    the performance of systems / hardware in relation to their brand new counterparts providing peace of mind for potential buyers who would then be able
                    to validate the performance reducing any risks within the second hand market.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Established in August 2018, Computers and Crafts expanded into more markets looking to bring good value to consumers while maintaining a strong 
                    environmentally friendly approach to industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're hoping to further expand our media outlets and improve our relationship with the industry leaders, allowing us to bring you
                    more information to better help understand the market, provide exceptional quality service and grant us the tools to bring future products to market.
